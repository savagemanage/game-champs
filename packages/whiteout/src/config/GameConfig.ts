 * world is locked in an endless winter and the settlement survives around a
 * central Furnace whose Ember must never go out: resource buildings passively
 * generate food, wood, coal, and iron; the Furnace gates the level cap of every
 * other building; troops are trained in time-based queues; and periodic waves
 * of the Frozen Horde must be repelled in a light tower-defense-flavored
 * battle. All naming, lore, art, and audio are original and role-based.
 *
 * Keep balance numbers here so the whole game can be tuned in one place. Later
 * features (economy, buildings, training, combat, save/load, warmth) extend the
 * config modules under src/config/ rather than scattering magic numbers.
