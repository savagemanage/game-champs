/**
 * Phaser bootstrap for Frosthold: Last Ember.
 *
 * Scene flow: Boot -> Preload (loads the generated art/audio) -> Title -> Town
 * (the idle front end) with Settings and Battle reachable from the town. The
 * Battle scene resolves a wave via CombatSystem and hands off to GameOver for
 * the result summary before returning to Town.
 *
 * MOBILE-FILL + CRISP-TEXT RENDER PIPELINE (FEAT-002, shared)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * The whole game is laid out in a fixed 960x540 LOGICAL coordinate system
 * (CANVAS). Two problems are solved here through the SHARED @open-games/shared
 * render module (single source of truth across every game):
 *
 *  1. PORTRAIT FILL. The game is landscape 16:9; on a portrait phone
 *     (e.g. 390x844) Scale.FIT of a fixed 960x540 canvas shrank it into a thin
 *     letterboxed band. We now grow the GAME SURFACE to the live viewport aspect
 *     (resolveViewportPlan -> resolveFillPlan) so FIT fills the screen with no
 *     band, and center the untouched 960x540 layout inside it via the camera
 *     scroll the plan returns. Scenes need NO coordinate changes.
 *
 *  2. CRISP TEXT. The backbuffer is sized to the real displayed physical pixels
 *     (fill size * a whole-number renderScale that tracks DPR AND the
 *     displayed-vs-logical ratio) and each scene's main camera is zoomed by the
 *     same scale, so text rasterizes at display resolution while the logical
 *     coordinate space is preserved. The DPR is CLAMPED (shared clampDpr) so a
 *     hi-DPR phone never allocates an oversized WebGL backbuffer (the reported
 *     mobile tab crashes).
 *
 * The plan is recomputed on every window resize / orientationchange (see
 * registerRenderScale) so the surface, buffer, and camera track the live
 * viewport.
