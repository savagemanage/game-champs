/**
 * GameConfig - centralized, config-driven tuning for Kingdom Rise.
 *
 * Kingdom Rise is an ORIGINAL-world medieval strategy / idle game. The player
 * grows a small settlement: resource buildings passively generate food, wood,
 * stone, and gold; a central Town Center gates the level cap of every other
 * building; troops are trained in time-based queues; and the player manually
 * starts each of the 20 deterministic defense battles when ready. All
 * naming, lore, art, and audio are original and role-based; nothing is drawn
 * from any existing IP.
 *
 * Keep balance numbers here so the whole game can be tuned in one place. Later
 * features (economy, buildings, training, combat, save/load) extend the config
 * modules under src/config/ rather than scattering magic numbers.

 * building is required: raising the Town Center both warms a larger keep and
