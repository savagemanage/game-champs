/**
 * Phaser bootstrap for LAST SQUAD (라스트 스쿼드).
 *
 * Scene flow: Boot -> Preload (loads the generated art/audio) -> Title -> Home.
 * The Title's primary action enters the HomeScene base hub, whose persistent
 * bottom-nav reaches every top-level system (Base, Heroes, Campaign, Missions,
 * Season) and launches the Falcon Rescue mini-game: a Run (the core lane
 * gate-runner loop) that resolves to Results, from which the player can
 * Redeploy, spend coins in the Upgrade screen, or return. Settings is reachable
 * from both the Title and the Home hub. Base management, the Heroes roster, and
 * the squad Formation board (FEAT-006) are registered here and reached from the
 * Home nav; the Campaign/Missions/Season/Battle scenes are added by FEAT-007
 * (until then the Home nav guards those hops with a scene-existence check).
 *
 * The canvas is a portrait 540x960 design resolution, scaled to fit while
 * centred.
 *
 * TEXT-CRISPNESS: the config deliberately does NOT set `pixelArt: true` and
 * does NOT force `image-rendering: pixelated` on the canvas (that CSS rule was
 * removed from index.html too). Under Scale.FIT the 540x960 canvas is almost
 * always displayed at a NON-INTEGER scale (e.g. 0.75x on a narrow phone, 1.04x
 * on a slightly wider one). With nearest-neighbour canvas scaling, that
 * fractional resample smears/breaks every Phaser Text glyph - dense Hangul
 * strokes turn blurry, broken, and visually mis-centred. Letting the browser
 * scale the canvas with SMOOTH (bilinear) interpolation instead keeps the
 * high-resolution text (see TEXT_RESOLUTION in src/ui/UiText.ts, which
 * rasterizes glyphs at >=3x and scales up with devicePixelRatio) sharp at every
 * viewport size and DPR. The pixel-art world/UI sprites are kept crisp by
 * applying NEAREST filtering PER-TEXTURE in PreloadScene, not by pixelating the
 * whole canvas.
 *
 * BACKING-BUFFER RESOLUTION (scale.zoom): with only the above, the canvas
 * BACKING BUFFER is a fixed 540x960 device-independent pixels, and Scale.FIT
 * then stretches that buffer to whatever CSS size fits the viewport. On desktop
 * that is usually a DOWNSCALE (e.g. a 1440x820 dpr=1 window displays the portrait
 * canvas at ~461x820 CSS px), so the whole scene is rendered at only 540px wide
 * and shrunk - which is exactly what softens small Korean glyphs. To fix this at
 * the root we set `scale.zoom` to a computed render-scale factor: Phaser 3.80's
 * zoom multiplies ONLY the backing store, so the canvas becomes
 * `540*zoom x 960*zoom` physical pixels while the world/camera coordinate space
 * stays 540x960. Every scene lays out in the same logical space (no layout code
 * changes), but the buffer now carries enough device pixels to cover the display
 * (>= displayScale*dpr, see src/systems/RenderScale.ts), so the browser no longer
 * upscales a 540-wide buffer. FIT still fits+centers the (now larger) buffer into
 * the viewport, and the `#game` flex parent remains the sole centering owner
 * (autoCenter stays NO_CENTER). Note: Phaser 3 removed the old game-config
 * `resolution` property (it is a no-op) - `scale.zoom` is the supported knob.
 */

/**
 * Render-scale (scale.zoom) computed from the live viewport + DPR at boot. Guard
 * for an absent `window` (e.g. non-browser/test bundling) and fall back to 1,
