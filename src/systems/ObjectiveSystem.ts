/**
 * ObjectiveSystem - the Phaser-free new-player guidance/tutorial state machine.
 *
 * The Town screen is not obvious to a first-time player: most buildings read
 * '잠김' (Locked) with no explanation and there is no visual "do this next".
 * This module computes the SINGLE next-step objective the player should act on,
 * from a plain, read-only view of the simulation - so the scene can drive a
 * banner + a building pointer/glow off one pure, deterministic function.
 *
 * It is intentionally pure: no Phaser, no Date.now, no Math.random. Given the
 * same {@link ObjectiveView} it always returns the same {@link Objective} (or
 * null when the guided flow is complete), so it is trivially unit-testable and
 * agrees between any callers.
 *
 * The core loop is modelled as an ORDERED list of objectives:
 *   1. Upgrade the Furnace (raise the level cap of everything else)
 *   2. Build the Hunters' Hut (rations / food)
 *   3. Build the Sawmill (timber / wood)
 *   4. Raise the Furnace again (unlock the War Camp tier)
 *   5. Build the War Camp (unlock troop training)
 *   6. Train troops
 *   7. March To Battle
 * The first objective whose {@link Objective.isComplete} predicate is false is
 * the current one; when all are complete the tutorial is done (returns null).
 *
 * A LOW-WARMTH advisory takes PRIORITY over the ordered list whenever the
 * warmth ratio is low: a freezing hold produces almost nothing, so the most
 * useful next step is to keep wood/coal stocked and raise the Furnace, not to
 * push the build order. The advisory also surfaces for returning players (whose
 * ordered tutorial is already complete) so the "what do I do about FREEZING?"
 * question always has an actionable answer.
